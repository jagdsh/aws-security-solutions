# Why encryption?

## Encryption in flight (TLS / SSL)

- Data is encrypted before sending and decrypted after receiving
- TLS certificates help with encryption (HTTPS)
- Encryption in flight ensures no MITM (man in the middle attack) can
happen

## Server-side encryption at rest

- Data is encrypted after being received by the server
- Data is decrypted before being sent
- It is stored in an encrypted form thanks to a key (usually a data key)
- The encryption / decryption keys must be managed somewhere, and
the server must have access to it

## Client-side encryption

- Data is encrypted by the client and never decrypted by the server
- Data will be decrypted by a receiving client
- The server should not be able to decrypt the data
- Could leverage Envelope Encryption
