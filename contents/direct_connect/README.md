# Direct Connect (DX)

- Provides a dedicated private connection from a remote network to your VPC
- Dedicated connection must be setup between your DC and AWS Direct Connect locations
- You need to setup a Virtual Private Gateway on your VPC
- Access public resources (S3) and private (EC2) on same connection
- Use Cases:
  - Increase bandwidth throughput - working with large data sets â€“ lower cost
  - More consistent network experience - applications using real-time data feeds
  - Hybrid Environments (on prem + cloud)
- Supports both IPv4 and IPv6

### Gateway

- If you want to setup a Direct Connect to one or more VPC in many different regions (same account), you must use a Direct Connect Gateway

### Connection Types

- Dedicated Connections: 1Gbps,10 Gbps and 100 Gbps capacity
  - Physical ethernet port dedicated to a customer
  - Request made to AWS first, then completed by AWS Direct Connect Partners
- Hosted Connections: 50Mbps, 500 Mbps, to 10 Gbps
  - Connection requests are made via AWS Direct Connect Partners
  - Capacity can be added or removed on demand
  - 1, 2, 5, 10 Gbps available at select AWS Direct Connect Partners
- Lead times are often longer than 1 month to establish a new connection

### Encryption

- Data in transit is not encrypted but is private
- AWS Direct Connect + VPN provides an IPsec-encrypted private connection
- Good for an extra level of security, but slightly more complex to put in place

### Resiliency

High Resiliency for Critical Workloads

One connection at multiple locations

Maximum Resiliency for Critical Workloads

Maximum resilience is achieved by separate connections terminating on separate devices in more than one location.

### Site-to-Site VPN connection as a backup

- In case Direct Connect fails, you can set up a backup Direct Connect connection (expensive), or a Site-to-Site VPN connection
